					    <strong>XVI. GENERAL</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
					    These Terms of Service constitutes the entire agreement between You and Vantage and governs your use of the Service, superseding any prior version of these
					    Terms of Service. You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use or purchase certain other Vantage services,
					    affiliate services, third-party content or third-party software.
					</p>
					<p>
					    You and Vantage agree that the Terms of Service and the relationship between you shall be governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania without
					    regard to its conflict of law provisions and that all claims, causes of action or disputes (regardless of theory) arising out of or relating to the Terms
					    of Service, or the relationship between you and Vantage, shall be brought exclusively in the state and federal courts of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,
					    for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. You agree to waive all objections to the exercise of jurisdiction over the parties by such courts and to venue in
					    such courts in any such dispute. These Terms of Service will not be governed by the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of
					    Goods, the application of which is expressly excluded.
					</p>
					<p>
					    The failure of Vantage to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If
					    any provision of the Terms of Service is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should
					    endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the Terms of Service remain in full force and
					    effect. These Terms of Service, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by Vantage
					    without restriction. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the
					    Vantage Services or the Terms of Service must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.
